Problem 1:

You will be given an array of integers, write a recursive solution to print it in reverse order.


Input:
5
69 87 45 21 47
Output:
47 21 45 87 69

Problem 2:
Skipping

Problem 3:

Write a recursive program to remove all odd integers from an array. You must not use any extra array or print anything in the function. Just read input, call the recursive function, then print the array in main().

Input:
6
1 54 88 6 55 7
Output:
54 88 6

Problem 4:

Write a recursive solution to print the polynomial series for any input n:
1 + x + x2 + ................. + xn-1

Input:
5
Output:
1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4

Problem 12:

Write a recursive solution to find the second maximum number from a given set of integers.


Input:
5
5 8 7 9 3
Output:
8
